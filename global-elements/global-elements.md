### Our Global elements section contains structural elements that can be used to create the foundation of a webpage as well as elements that appear on every page. These elements are part of CFPB's [Capital Framework](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/), a set of front-end components built by in-house designers and developers to help us create visually consistent web products as easily as possible.
