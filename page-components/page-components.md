### Our Page components section includes individual UI elements that can be used to design a webpage. These elements are part of CFPB's [Capital Framework](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/), a set of front-end components built by in-house designers and developers to help us create visually consistent web products as easily as possible.
